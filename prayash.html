        What is tree?
A tree as an abstract data type (ADT) is a hierarchical structure that
consists of nodes connected by edges, where one node is designated as the
root, and all other nodes are organized into parent-child relationships.
Example?: Taxonomy

Mathematical Definition of a Tree
Definition
A tree is a connected, acyclic graph. Formally:
A tree is a graph T = (V, E),
where:
V is the set of vertices (nodes).
E ⊆ {(u, v) | u, v ∈ V, u 6= v} is the set of edges
The tree satisfies:
Connectedness: There is exactly one path between any two vertices in
V.
Acyclicity: There are no cycles in T.
</p>

Properties of a Tree
For a tree with n nodes:
The number of edges is n − 1.
Removing any edge disconnects the tree (it becomes two
disconnected subtrees).
Adding any edge creates exactly one cycle.
Each element/node, except the root node, can have only one
predecessor.
